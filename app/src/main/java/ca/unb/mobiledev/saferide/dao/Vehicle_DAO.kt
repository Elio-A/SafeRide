    /*
    TODO CRUD queries for vehicles
        Don't forget to add the seat capacity per vehicle.
        This is needed in order to retrieve the max number
        of drop offs a driver can do per trip
         Im thinking we can also change the Driver view of Vehicles
         To list vehicles that are listed in the database, instead of
         hardcoding 3 vehicles. Just a thought, if you want to look
         into it. we can use ByteString to store an image
         Good practice too
